```jsx title="/src/components/HelloCodeTitle.js"
function HelloCodeTitle(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```

:::note

The snapshot is directly scoped to the data you render â€“ in our example the `<Link>` component with `page` prop passed to it. This implies that even if any other file has missing props (say, `App.js`) in the `<Link>` component, it will still pass the test as the test doesn't know the usage of `<Link>` component and it's scoped only to the `Link.js`. Also, rendering the same component with different props in other snapshot tests will not affect the first one, as the tests don't know about each other.

More information on how snapshot testing works and why we built it can be found on the [release blog post](/blog/2016/07/27/jest-14). We recommend reading [this blog post](http://benmccormick.org/2016/09/19/testing-with-jest-snapshots-first-impressions/) to get a good sense of when you should use snapshot testing. We also recommend watching this [egghead video](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-use-jest-s-snapshot-testing-feature?pl=testing-javascript-with-jest-a36c4074) on Snapshot Testing with Jest.
